# AutoExecute

Inspired by John Hammond's [Poor Mans Pentest](https://github.com/JohnHammond/poor-mans-pentest) which relies on the use of of Guake to automate common pentesting tasks, I wanted to build a tool that would run on any terminal emulator.  

This project is in a very early stage, but I hope to add new features and automations regularly.  

The tool is written in Python and leverages global hotkeys to automate common taks required during pentesting.
